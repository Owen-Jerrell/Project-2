        <p class="intro">This match was quite explosive, figuratively and literally. The up-and-coming team of the season, Version1, won the set 4-1, but it was Game 3 that really shined. Comm from V1 managed to beat the demolition record by landing 20 demos on NRG, winning the game after an extra game and a half of overtime.</p>
