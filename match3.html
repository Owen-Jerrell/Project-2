        <p class="intro">This match had a lot of buildup to it, and the result was far from disappointing. The star underdog of the match, Team Furia, came from South America, a region considered to be outclassed by North America and Europe. This season though, Furia was fighting to prove everyone wrong. Their opponents were Moist Esports, a team that they had lost to in the first major of the season. The match is a true spectacle to watch.</p>
